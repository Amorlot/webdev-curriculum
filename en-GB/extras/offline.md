When completing our HTML & CSS projects, we recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io) to build webpages online. Trinket offers several advantages over using a text editor offline:

+ Children can see a live preview of their HTML & CSS code;
+ Children can save their code online, allowing them to access their webpages both within their club and at home;
+ Children can share their webpages with others, and can remix webpages shared with them.

However, there may be times when children in your club will need to write HTML & CSS code offline. The following is a guide to writing, editing and viewing HTML & CSS offline.

####Writing

Open a text editor. We recommend [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), but there are loads of other good editors available. If you don't want to write your own HTML from scratch, you can download a template HTML document in the 'Project Resources' for each HTML project.

Here's a _very_ simple HTML example:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      p {
        color: red;  
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

####Saving

After writing your HTML, save your file - making sure that the file has a `.html` file extension.

####Viewing

To view a webpage, double-click the file to open it in a browser.

If your file opens in a text editor, make sure that it has a `.html` file extension.

####Editing

To edit your webpage, right-click the `.html` file and select a text editor to open the file with.

The easiest way to make changes is to open the file in a browser _and_ a text editor. You can then make changes in the text editor, save the file and then click refresh in the browser to see your changes.
